    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Right now I'm deeply involved with organizing the <a href="http://battlehack.org/berlin/">Berlin stage</a> of PayPal's series of hackathons called Battle Hack. If you've ever organized a hackathon or in case you're interested in doing so this post might be a great help for getting started.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This is going to be a series of 2 posts. This post is going to focus mostly on the Hack Day Manifesto and doing analytics right. The second post (to be release in the next two or three days) will focus on finding the right partners and working on your message.</p>

<h2>The Hack Day Manifesto</h2>

<p>First of all: Read the <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">Hack Day Manifesto</a>. Now read it again. This is an amazingly useful how-to that covers most of the really important topics like finding a decent venue and making sure that your network doesn't suck. This amazing project was started by the <a href="http://geeksoflondon.com/">Geeks of London</a> and is easily one of the most interesting sources of information out there.</p>

<p>I'll not try to write another Hack Day Manifesto over here. This post is more about some useful additions that might help to make your event awesome.</p>

<p>Some of the content of the Manifesto might not make sense for your hackday but at least you might consider it.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>

<p>Whenever creating a project it absolutely makes sense to analyze your activities and optimizing them to have the best possible outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Newsletters:</strong>
Newsletters are possibly one of the best ways to reach a broad audience. To optimize your outcome using a tool that allows for deep analytics makes absolutely sense. In the case of Battle Hack we're using <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/">Campaign Monitor</a>. This will help to target users that already registered for the event or users that might have opened the email but didn't register yet.</p>

<p><strong>Registration:</strong>
Of course building a registration can be big fun but to be honest: Use something that users already know (and maybe even have a dedicated account for). For Battle Hack we needed a scalable solution that allows to track 10 local stages. We've been trying <a href="http://splashthat.com/">Splash</a> initially but quickly dropped it in favour of <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>. While Splash might allow for nicer looking sites and more customization, Eventbrite simply has the best dashboard &amp; adminstration. We're heavily using the analytics &amp; charts that Eventbrite provides us to check the outcome of different campaigns and adjust our buzz generation for the hacks and are pretty happy with the available tools.</p>

<p><strong>Online:</strong>
This is not a big surprise: Google Analytics. Not sure you need to add anything over here.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media:</strong>
I'm heavily using <a href="http://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a> to keep track of my social activities on LinkedIn, Twitter &amp; Facebook. This provides me the "reach" of my activity and the resulting reactions. Buffer easily became one of my favourite apps and really deserves a mention over here.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>Organizing a great hackday takes huge effort and work before the actual event. Doing analytics to check if your work acutally makes sense is a great help. Refining your message and reshaping your content / site is sometimes necessary and can be pretty rewarding. I'm more than happy to hear your feedback and even add more points that might help future organizers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last weekend the famous <a href="http://angelhack.com/">AngelHack</a> came to Berlin to find the best local hackers. The winning teams are going to be mentored for 3 months and will be shipped over to the US afterwards to raise investments, meet VCs etc. in the Valley.</p>

<p><img class="no-box center" src="/images/posts/angelhack.png" title="AngelHack" ></p>

<p>This years winner was <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/edgar">edgar</a> - a beautiful product that tries to help small medium business that are not as Internet-oriented as others to build an online presence for their product and tell the story behind them.</p>

<p>Winner of the PayPal category was a product called <a href="http://travelo.me/">travelo.me</a>. travelo aims at people that are upset with the difficulty of planning (private) trips. It optimizes routes between sights and proposes new landmarks that might be of interest for you.</p>

<h2>What I liked:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The teams were really international - I met lots of people coming from other cities or even countries</li>
<li>There were a lot of people in the AngelHack team trying to help participants, speakers and sponsors (thanks!)</li>
<li>The organizer tried to get the 'spirit' of AngelHack to Berlin</li>
<li>Lots of projects (I counted 30) and a good amount of hackers (~ 140)</li>
<li>The jury consisted of a good mixture (startups, developers, business)</li>
<li>Enough cold drinks (especially Club Mate)</li>
</ul>


<h2>What I didn't like:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The WiFi at the Immobilien Scout Office was too slow since not being dimensioned for ~ 140 developers</li>
<li>There was a shortage of food (at least on the first day)</li>
<li>The location didn't have enough power outlets for the teams (especially applies to the Scout Casino)</li>
<li>There was no desk for the presenters - thus live coding was nearly impossible</li>
<li>There was no handsfree mic for the presenters - thus live coding was nearly impossible</li>
</ul>


<h2>Bottom line:</h2>

<p>The first AngelHack in Berlin was good. For the next time I'd love to see some of the dislikes being addressed. There is lots of potential for professional (&amp; even paid) hackathons in Germany and especially in Berlin.</p>

<h2>Thanks:</h2>

<p>Thanks to the team around <a href="http://www.youisnow.de/">YouIsNow</a> that managed the whole hack and a special thanks to the team of <a href="http://mailjet.com">Mailjet</a> and <a href="http://www.paymill.com">Paymill</a> for a nice weekend.</p>
