It's time to officially announce that I am parting ways with PayPal. After more than three and a half years of working with the PayPal and Braintree Developer Relations team, it is time for me to move on, seek new adventures and expose myself to new challenges.

I am incredibly excited to publicize that I will join Google's Developer Relations team as Program Manager for the German speaking market. Google always invested time, energy and resources into the developer and startup community and I am very happy to be able to contribute to their efforts.

My work at PayPal and Braintree exposed me to many brilliant people and I'd like to thank all of you for your feedback and advice throughout my time in this company. Another thanks goes to the community for embracing me, allowing me to share my thoughts and opinions on stages across the world and by suprising me on a daily base.

Tim
