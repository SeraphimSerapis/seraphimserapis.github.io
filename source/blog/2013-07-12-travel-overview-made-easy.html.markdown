As mentioned in earlier posts (like ["What's in Your bag?"](/blog/2013/05/08/whats-in-your-bag/)) I love to travel and have to travel a lot for work. One of the biggest issues for me is having an overview of all my different trips and getting detailed information of each and every single one.

<!-- more -->

Of course the easiest solution is working with your calendar and just adding flight information to it manually or via the .ics files that usually get sent with your flight's information. That worked for me but also implied that I had to spend more time searching for the information I wanted. Also there's still the need to store information like your hotel's address, how to get there and your booking reference.

Gladly friends and colleagues recommended [TripIt](https://www.tripit.com/) to me which does most of these things for you. Gladly the travel agency that we're working with is sending emails in a format that TripIt can automatically parse when forwarding that mail to plans@tripit.com. This auto import saves tons of time and the app basically provides each and every single information I need.

On top of that we've got TripIt for Teams to see where the other people of our Developer Relations team are and synchronize travel schedules. Also I'm paying TripIt Pro to get flight alerts (like delays) and keep track of loyalty programs.

For me this app (& website) is basically the swiss army knife of travel planning and execution. Still I'm always looking for new ideas or recommendations that help to improve my travels - anything is welcome.

### Update:

My friend [Aygul](http://www.aygul.de/) made an interesting comment about this post on Facebook. Basically she stated that TripIt didn't change a lot regarding UX & UI since about 3 years. I have to agree with that - the site doesn't feel very modern and the app could be a bit more responsive and could benefit from a nicer UI. Still TripIt is very functional.

Another thing she mentioned (which is correct): You don't need to spend any money for using the core functionality. All the Pro or Team features are pure comfort and not really required.
