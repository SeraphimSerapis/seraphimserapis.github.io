One of the applications for Mac OS that I especially adore is [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/). Having used [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/) and also the inbuilt search system Spotlight I was looking for something that adds more productivity and utility to my workflow.

I've been blogging already about [my Octopress Alfred Workflow](/blog/2013/05/11/octopress-alfred-workflow/) which enables quick generation of new posts using the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) editor of your choice. This example highlights the omnipresent functionality to execute a series of tasks or quickly find something.

On top of that there is a ton of useful workflows that can save using 2 or 3 tools combined. The Alfred team wrote a [blog post highlighting some awesome workflows](http://blog.alfredapp.com/post/2013/04/03/alfred-v2-workflows-a-few-of-our-favourites-so-far) on top of that a ton of people share their workflows in the [official forum](http://www.alfredforum.com/forum/3-share-your-workflows/):

- The [Unit converter](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/2133-unit-converter/) helps with calculating dollars in euros, miles in kilometers etc.  
- One other workflow I like is [Roll Some Dice](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/2859-roll-some-dice-update-101/) that helps to quickly generate a random number between x and y
- [Network Info](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/11-my-ip/?p=2909) shows your external IP and your Mac address

There is many more interesting workflows and I can just encourage everybody to try Alfred out.
