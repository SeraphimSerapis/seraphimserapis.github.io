I've been using a MacBook Air for the last couple of years and have not had the pleasure of working with a Retina resolution Mac. This changed last week when I finally got my new shiny 2015 MacBook Pro 15" and got introduced to the world of sharp text and proper display resolutions.

While most of the apps that are being released for OSX nowadays support Retina resolutions out of the box, some apps sadly don't. This means that users have to deal with pixelated UIs that simply are not fun to use.

Gladly a quick search led to [Retinizer](http://retinizer.mikelpr.com/), a simple app that improves behaviour of Cocoa-based apps by drawing 1x widgets as 2x widgets.

The app is free (donations via PayPal are welcome) and is definitely worth a try.
