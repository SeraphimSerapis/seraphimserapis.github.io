On Monday & Tuesday last week our Developer Relations team has been visiting Droidcon Paris. We had a booth over there and I had a speech about our new Android SDK on the second day. In this post I want to summarize the event as lots of people asked me already if it's worth it to attend a first time event.

## The Event

I'm not really sure if you can say that Droidcon Paris is a first time event since Droidcon is basically the biggest series of Android events (at least in Europe) and organized by a really professional team. In Paris the guys of [WIPConnector](http://www.wipconnector.com/) did a pretty damn good job in finding a venue, getting good speakers and nailing there target audience.

In total 450 attendees came to the event and made sure that we had 2 busy days at our booth speaking with everyone, meeting some old friends from other Android-related events and enjoying of course Paris as a city.

Especially the after-party on Monday is worth mentioning: The guys from WIP occupied a whole caf√© that served amazingly good food, nice beer and offered enough place for all attendees. This led to lots of mingling and getting to know the attendees even better.

## My Talk

As mentioned before I've been talking about our newly released Android SDK and our Identity product called *Log In with PayPal*. Objective of the talk was to present how easy an integration of payments into Android apps can be and which benefits using identites like Twitter, Facebook or PayPal sign-in can provide:

## Bottom line:

Our booth was next to Sony's and this related to a few interesting chats and pure jealousy of their really nicely designed booth ;). The event's organization was amazing and except the WiFi breakdown on Day 1 everything went amazingly well. We're really looking forward to next year's edition and will make sure to be present again.
