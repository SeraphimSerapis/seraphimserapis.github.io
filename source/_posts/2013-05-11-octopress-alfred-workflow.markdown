This is just a very short post highlighting a very nice Alfred workflow that adds support for creating new posts for Octopress or regenerating the site.

You can find the workflow over [at the Alfred forums](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/2289-octopress-publisher/) or [at GitHub](https://github.com/Temikus/alfred-octopress/).

To me this is very useful since I don't need to open iTerm first, navigate to my blog's folder, create a new file using rake and open the file in vi(m) or [Mou](http://mouapp.com/).
