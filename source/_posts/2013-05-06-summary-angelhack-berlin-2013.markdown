Over the last weekend the famous [AngelHack](http://angelhack.com/) came to Berlin to find the best local hackers. The winning teams are going to be mentored for 3 months and will be shipped over to the US afterwards to raise investments, meet VCs etc. in the Valley.

This years winner was [edgar](http://www.hackathon.io/edgar) - a beautiful product that tries to help small medium business that are not as Internet-oriented as others to build an online presence for their product and tell the story behind them.

Winner of the PayPal category was a product called [travelo.me](http://travelo.me/). travelo aims at people that are upset with the difficulty of planning (private) trips. It optimizes routes between sights and proposes new landmarks that might be of interest for you.

What I liked:
--
- The teams were really international - I met lots of people coming from other cities or even countries
- There were a lot of people in the AngelHack team trying to help participants, speakers and sponsors (thanks!)
- The organizer tried to get the 'spirit' of AngelHack to Berlin
- Lots of projects (I counted 30) and a good amount of hackers (~ 140)
- The jury consisted of a good mixture (startups, developers, business)
- Enough cold drinks (especially Club Mate)

What I didn't like:
--
- The WiFi at the Immobilien Scout Office was too slow since not being dimensioned for ~ 140 developers
- There was a shortage of food (at least on the first day)
- The location didn't have enough power outlets for the teams (especially applies to the Scout Casino)
- There was no desk for the presenters - thus live coding was nearly impossible
- There was no handsfree mic for the presenters - thus live coding was nearly impossible

Bottom line:
--
The first AngelHack in Berlin was good. For the next time I'd love to see some of the dislikes being addressed. There is lots of potential for professional (& even paid) hackathons in Germany and especially in Berlin.

Thanks to the team around [YouIsNow](http://www.youisnow.de/) that managed the whole hack and a special thanks to the team of [Mailjet](http://mailjet.com) and [Paymill](http://www.paymill.com) for a nice weekend.
