    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is just a very short post highlighting a very nice Alfred workflow that adds support for creating new posts for Octopress or regenerating the site. Furthermore I&#8217;ll quickly describe how I post my stuff to GitHub.</p>

<p>You can find the workflow over <a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/2289-octopress-publisher/">at the Alfred forums</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Temikus/alfred-octopress/">at GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To me this is very useful since I don&#8217;t need to open iTerm first, navigate to my blog&#8217;s folder, create a new file using rake and open the file in vi(m) or <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a>.</p>

<p>This is my Git workflow to test the blog locally and add new posts:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>alias octopush='git push origin source && rake generate && rake deploy'
</span><span class='line'>alias octoprev='rake generate && rake preview'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Place that into your .zshrc or .bashrc or whatever you use and you only have to do the following before:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git add .
</span><span class='line'>git commit -am "My fancy message"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Basically I test before commiting with <code>octoprev</code> and use <code>octopush</code> afterwards to push to GitHub.</p>

    <id>http://seraphimserapis.github.io/blog/2013/05/08/whats-in-your-bag</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I do a lot working as Developer Evangelist is traveling. Flying from Berlin to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to London and back to Berlin. From Berlin to Vilnius and from Vilnius to Stockholm and back. And so on and so on and so on. When I meet people who travel as much as I do one of the big topic is mostly organizing and optimizing travels. Especially: What do you take with you when traveling? This post tries to highlight some key important things to me when traveling light (for max 2 days), medium (2 to 5 days) or heavy (5 days and above).</p>

<h2>Traveling light</h2>

<p>Traveling light is from the baggage perspective my most favorite thing to do. The reason why: I don&#8217;t get to carry around to much stuff when being at the airport, getting to the hotel using public transport or a cab or being at events.</p>

<p>The key element for this is my backpack. It&#8217;s a Dakine that&#8217;s already a few years old (about 5 or 6?!) and does everything I need when traveling. It has a special padded pocket for my Mac, one for glasses (which I misuse for business cards), one for keys and documents and which is designed to keep stuff cool but I misuse it for chargers, cables and adapters.</p>

<p>What do I take with me when traveling light?</p>

<ul>
<li>MacBook Pro, 15&#8221; (Late 2012) with 8GB Ram and a Core i7 @ 2.4 GHz</li>
<li>iPhone 4S (Company phone)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lightning-Thunderbolt-Blackberry-connectors-customized/dp/B009USAJCC">Anker Mobile Battery</a> which charges up my phone about 4-5 times</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-eneloop-KBC-L2B-Mobile-Booster/dp/B004BQJXJI">Sanyo Mobile Booster</a> - another battery (tinier) that charges up my phone about 2-3 times</li>
<li>Sunglasses (if it makes sense - sadly I almost always forget them)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bose%C2%AE-QuietComfort%C2%AE-Acoustic-Cancelling%C2%AE-Headphones/dp/B0054JJ0QW">Bose QC15 Noise Cancelling Headset</a> - helps to actually be productive at airports.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/AKG-Acoustics-K375-Headphone-Black/dp/B00A1UHM1Y">AKG K375</a> In-ear headphone - more mobile than the Bose and doesn&#8217;t require battery</li>
<li>Lots of different cables (iPhone / iPad cable, USB, &#8230;)</li>
<li>Dextro Energy (dextrose) - to get some energy in</li>
<li>A small notebook and a pen</li>
</ul>


<p>When not traveling in Europe I always take with me:
- Country-specific Mac adaptors (I bought the travel-kit once)
- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charger-Designed-Quality-Blackberrys-Countries/dp/B002G90I3M">A Skross World Adapter</a> with 2 USB connectors
- Passport (useful also in UK)</p>

<h2>Traveling medium</h2>

<p>Traveling medium is needed if I get to stay for a bit longer at one event or I need to connect them because traveling back to Berlin to get new stuff doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>

<p>In this case I need to get both my backpack and a tiny suitcase (which has the optimum size for handluggage). Basically I put everything inside my backpack that I mentioned above already PLUS more clothes and additionally this tech:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Gaming-Speakers-RZ05-00500100-R3/dp/B004L2JPS6">Razer Ferox speakers</a> (charged via USB) that spice up listening to Music / watching movies in the hotel</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPort-Express-Station-MC414LL/dp/B008ALA2RC/">Apple Airport Express</a> for connecting to the hotel&#8217;s LAN and having a real good WiFi</li>
<li>LAN cable (to connect the Airport Express to the room&#8217;s LAN port)</li>
<li>iPad 3 32GB wih 3G (for gaming and reading stuff)</li>
<li>Kindle Paperwhite (reading stuff, again)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Traveling heavy</h2>

<p>Traveling heavy replaces the tiny suitcase by a big one (that can contain enough stuff for two weeks).</p>

<p>So this happens when I travel over to the US or do marathon events like Mobile World Congress or LeWeb with lots of satellite events around the event itself. This only happens a few times (&lt; 10) a year. This is when I bring more stuff to develop with.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nexus 4 16GB</li>
<li>Nexus 7 16GB</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse-G700/dp/B003VAM32E">Logitech G700 Mouse</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>When having a presentation</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve got a tiny bag that sits in my backpack and contains:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-910-001354-Wireless-Presenter-R400/dp/B002GHBUTK">Logitech R400</a></li>
<li>Display Adapter VGA</li>
<li>Display Adapter DVI</li>
<li>Display Adapter HDMI</li>
</ul>


<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m very happy with discussing my &#8216;setup&#8217; and even receive some new ideas that could enhance my gear. The new stuff that I look into buying might be a better iPad Mini (Apple: Please release an iPad Mini with a Retina Display) and a MacBook Air 13&#8221; (because my Pro is sooo damn heavy).</p>

    <link href="http://seraphimserapis.github.io/blog/2013/05/06/summary-angelhack-berlin-2013/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-06T14:02:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://seraphimserapis.github.io/blog/2013/05/06/summary-angelhack-berlin-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last weekend the famous <a href="http://angelhack.com/">AngelHack</a> came to Berlin to find the best local hackers. The winning teams are going to be mentored for 3 months and will be shipped over to the US afterwards to raise investments, meet VCs etc. in the Valley.</p>

<p><img class="no-box center" src="http://seraphimserapis.github.io/images/posts/angelhack.png" title="AngelHack" ></p>

<p>This years winner was <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/edgar">edgar</a> - a beautiful product that tries to help small medium business that are not as Internet-oriented as others to build an online presence for their product and tell the story behind them.</p>

<p>Winner of the PayPal category was a product called <a href="http://travelo.me/">travelo.me</a>. travelo aims at people that are upset with the difficulty of planning (private) trips. It optimizes routes between sights and proposes new landmarks that might be of interest for you.</p>

<h2>What I liked:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The teams were really international - I met lots of people coming from other cities or even countries</li>
<li>There were a lot of people in the AngelHack team trying to help participants, speakers and sponsors (thanks!)</li>
<li>The organizer tried to get the &#8216;spirit&#8217; of AngelHack to Berlin</li>
<li>Lots of projects (I counted 30) and a good amount of hackers (~ 140)</li>
<li>The jury consisted of a good mixture (startups, developers, business)</li>
<li>Enough cold drinks (especially Club Mate)</li>
</ul>


<h2>What I didn&#8217;t like:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The WiFi at the Immobilien Scout Office was too slow since not being dimensioned for ~ 140 developers</li>
<li>There was a shortage of food (at least on the first day)</li>
<li>The location didn&#8217;t have enough power outlets for the teams (especially applies to the Scout Casino)</li>
<li>There was no desk for the presenters - thus live coding was nearly impossible</li>
<li>There was no handsfree mic for the presenters - thus live coding was nearly impossible</li>
</ul>


<h2>Bottom line:</h2>

<p>The first AngelHack in Berlin was good. For the next time I&#8217;d love to see some of the dislikes being addressed. There is lots of potential for professional (&amp; even paid) hackathons in Germany and especially in Berlin.</p>

<h2>Thanks:</h2>

<p>Thanks to the team around <a href="http://www.youisnow.de/">YouIsNow</a> that managed the whole hack and a special thanks to the team of <a href="http://mailjet.com">Mailjet</a> and <a href="http://www.paymill.com">Paymill</a> for a nice weekend.</p>

    <link href="http://seraphimserapis.github.io/blog/2013/05/06/a-new-start-using-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-06T11:16:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://seraphimserapis.github.io/blog/2013/05/06/a-new-start-using-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After I&#8217;ve spent some time <a href="http://timmesserschmidt.blogspot.com">blogging on Blogger</a> I wanted to try something new. The reason for that is not necessarily Blogger not being a good platform for your blog but me being eager to learn new stuff.</p>

<p>Having <a href="http://battlehack.org">worked with Jekyll before</a> it was pretty obvious to me that I wanted to go for a solution that allows me to configure my blog and adds some pretty cool functionality like nicely formatted code embeds, writing posts in Markdown and of course deploying my site to GitHub pages. I could have either used Jekyll itself (<a href="http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/05/06/jekyll-1-dot-0-released/">which just got bumped to version 1.0</a>) or used Octopress (which I do).</p>

<p>The reason I stick with Octopress is that it comes with a decent default theme (which I&#8217;ll tweak over time) and does a lot of configuration / JS /  … that Jekyll still requires to be done manually.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be blogging mainly about my life as Developer Evangelist, summarizing events I&#8217;ve been at and linking to interesting content I&#8217;ve found. Additionally I&#8217;ll be covering tools / apps / etc. that I like a lot and help me with being productive.</p>

<p>The reason I&#8217;m not importing stuff is that my old blog was a mess of both German and English posts and I didn&#8217;t really have a straight idea about what the content should be like.</p>
